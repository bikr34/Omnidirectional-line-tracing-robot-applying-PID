# Omnidirectional Line Tracing Robot with PID Control

Welcome to the **Omnidirectional Line Tracing Robot applying PID** repository! This project focuses on a robot that moves along a track based on sensor input and PID control. Unlike traditional robots that can only move forward or turn, this robot utilizes omnidirectional wheels, enabling it to move in any direction without rotating.

## Overview 🤖

The **Omnidirectional Line Tracing Robot** is equipped with advanced components to navigate along a marked path accurately. By integrating a PID control system, the robot achieves precise tracking and control, providing a seamless line following experience. The use of omnidirectional wheels enhances maneuverability, allowing the robot to move in multiple directions effortlessly.

## Key Features 🚀

- Line following capability using PID control
- Mecanum wheels for omnidirectional movement
- Integration with Arduino Uno for control
- Support for PS2 controller for manual operation
- Development environment setup in VSCode
